# TaaS : Talent as a Service!

The below characteristics are some of the top traits that all companies are looking for in new hires. **Why?**

 - **Flexible**
 - **Adaptable**
 - **Quick Learner**

In the current high-stakes tech industry, many companies have realized that their competitive advantage lies not in their fixed assets, but their people.

Common HR buzzwords these days include...
> gig-economy, crowd-sourcing, on-demand workforce

In some instances this leads to a commoditization of individuals (_**anti-synthesis**, if you will..._<sup>1</sup>), reducing them to a service that is to be rendered in exchange for money, it could be much more.

Companies may actively start recruiting for these characteristics in the people they hire and then...rely on these individuals to use these talents in adapting to an ever changing business world.

When these talents are seen as part of a whole individual and treated accordingly, magical things can happen.

It may result in these **talented, humble, hungry and smart** people, **NOT** staying in their lane!

<sup>1</sup> Actually, it's decomposition, taking the whole and reducing it to the sum of it's parts.
